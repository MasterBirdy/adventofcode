# Advent of Code Solutions

Hello, these are the solutions that I came up with for the Advent of Code 2020. For each of the problems, I try to give a quick explanation of the algorithm that I used to solve each part. I don't believe my solutions to be optimal by any means, and they could definitely be revised for efficiency. This is just what I used as a first pass to get the correct answer for the problems. This was a great learning experience for me, and I plan to participate in next year's as well.
